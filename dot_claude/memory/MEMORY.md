# 🧠 Global Memory

## 🔄 Memory Update Loop

After finishing any task, always run the End-of-Session Memory Loop. Announce it with `** **UPDATING MEMORY LOOP** **`.

⚠️ **MEMORY RULE CONFIRMED** ⚠️
The one and only valid save location for memory is `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`. This is absolute and non-negotiable. Never write to `.claude/projects/` or any other location — not as separate files, not as subdirectories, not ever. If it isn't going into `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` directly, it isn't being saved.

After reading and understanding this rule, confirm with: `** **MEMORY RULE CONFIRMED** **`

1. **Session learnings** — write ALL new insights, corrections, or findings into `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` under the appropriate section. NEVER write to project-specific memory files (`.claude/projects/`) — always use the global file.
2. **Memory review** — read all sections: shorten verbose entries, remove irrelevant content, deduplicate. Be conservative — memory should grow first, only trim what is clearly redundant or no longer applicable.

## 🖥️ Environment

### Linux

- **Shell**: fish — never use bash-specific syntax (no heredocs, no `&&`/`||` chaining outside fish syntax, no `[[ ]]`)
- **OS**: CachyOS (Arch-based), AUR helper: paru
- **Desktop**: Hyprland + SDDM
- **Font**: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font (confirmed in rofi)
- **Mouse**: Logitech MX Master 3 — solaar/wlrctl removed, no DPI tooling; use Hyprland mousemode submap (`SUPER+M`) for keyboard-driven scrolling via ydotool
- **Hyprland notes**: `wlrctl` segfaults on this system; `wtype` cannot release physically-held modifiers (Super bleeds into keystrokes when used in `bind exec`); mousemode submap is the reliable approach for mouse emulation

### macOS (legacy)

- **Shell**: fish (macOS-only, excluded on Linux via chezmoi)
- **WM**: AeroSpace
- **Bar**: Sketchybar (Lua-based, Homebrew HEAD)
- **Monitors**: LG Ultra HD (secondary) + LG HDR 4K (main) + optional Sidecar (iPad)

## ⚙️ Behavior Rules

### 🎉 Emojis

Use emojis freely and enthusiastically in all responses — the more the merrier! 😄
Sprinkle them throughout without restraint. 🚀✨

### ✂️ Conciseness

Concise responses — skip preamble and summaries. Confirm before making edits when asked to do so.

### 🗃️ Shorthand: "chezmoi"

When Joerg writes just **"chezmoi"**, that means: re-add all files changed during the session and add any new `~/.config` files introduced this session. Then verify nothing was missed — cross-check all session-touched files against `chezmoi list` and run `chezmoi re-add` or `chezmoi add` on any that aren't yet tracked. Do it, don't suggest it.

### 🔁 Shorthand: "loop"

When Joerg writes just **"loop"**, that means: run the full End-of-Session Memory Loop — reflect on everything learned this session, write new insights to `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` (the global file), and review existing entries for staleness or duplication. **Never write to project-specific memory files.**

### 📋 Commands to Copy-Paste

When showing commands the user needs to run themselves, **never prefix them with `!`**. Joerg copies commands directly and the `!` breaks them.

### 🧠 Memory Load Confirmation

At the start of every session, include `** **GLOBAL MEMORY LOADED** **` in the first response to confirm the memory injection was successful. Skip this on `q:` sessions.

### ⚡ Quick Questions

If the session starts with `q:` — no memory writes, no end-of-session loop.

### 🐟 Fish Shell

Never use bash-specific syntax. No heredocs, no `&&`/`||` chaining outside fish syntax, no `[[ ]]`.

### 📁 Chezmoi Sync

Only files under `~/.config` need chezmoi attention. After any session involving `~/.config` changes:

- Run a sync check: verify all user-tracked `~/.config` files are in sync with chezmoi
- If a tracked file was changed: **actually run** `chezmoi re-add <path>` — do not just suggest it to the user
- If a new `~/.config` file was created during the session that affects the look or behavior of the machine (cursor, theme, keybindings, bar config, etc.) — add it to chezmoi with `chezmoi add <path>`. Don't ask, just do it.
- Never add files that are clearly auto-generated, caches, or runtime state

`~/.claude` is synced via a separate user script — do NOT chezmoi re-add anything under `~/.claude`.
`~/scripts` is git-managed — do NOT chezmoi anything there either.

---

## 🍎 macOS Config

### AeroSpace

- Config: `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`, helpers in `~/.config/aerospace/`
- Known limitation: floating window positioning unreliable on secondary monitors — [issue #1519](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1519)
- Ghostty new windows: use AppleScript Cmd+N approach, NOT direct binary launch (causes multiple dock icons)

### Sketchybar

- Installed via Homebrew HEAD (`felixkratz/formulae/sketchybar`)
- Config: `~/.config/sketchybar/` (Lua-based, `sketchybarrc` → `init.lua`)
- **SkyLight fix**: macOS 15.7.4 broke stable sketchybar 2.23.0. Fix: `brew uninstall sketchybar && brew install --HEAD sketchybar`. Also re-grant Screen Recording permission (TCC entries are path-specific).
- `display=0` (all displays) is broken — must use explicit `display=1,2`
- `brew outdated` crashes in sketchybar sandbox — use launchd job writing to `/tmp/sketchybar_brew_count`
- `updates = "when_shown"` means routine events don't fire when `drawing = false` — use `updates = "on"` for widgets that start hidden
- After brew version changes, always check TCC permissions — they're path-specific

### Neovim

- Config: `~/.config/nvim/`, keymaps: `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua`
- `ft` is NOT a valid which-key field — use `cond = function() return vim.bo.filetype == "markdown" end`
- Nerd Font icon copy-paste through Claude terminal loses the character — write via Python: `python3 -c "icon = '\uf48a'; ..."`
- LazyExtras managed via `lazyvim.json` extras array — do NOT manually import extras in `lazy.lua` (causes "not managed by LazyExtras" warning). Keymap: `<leader>lx` → `:LazyExtras`
- LazyVim extras (`lang.yaml`, `lang.json`, etc.) bundle LSP + formatter + linter per language; Mason installs the actual binaries into `~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/`
- YAML formatter: use `yamlfmt` (Go, fast, YAML-aware) over `prettier` (Node.js, generalist) — set in `formatting.lua` as `opts.formatters_by_ft["yaml"] = { "yamlfmt" }`
- LazyVim `lang.yaml` extra does NOT wire up formatter by default — must explicitly add to `formatting.lua`
- Both `yamlfmt` and `prettier` refuse to format syntactically invalid YAML (indentation errors = parse errors in YAML) — LSP diagnostics are the real-time safety net
- CloudFormation `!Ref`, `!Sub`, `!If` etc. are YAML custom tags — not in any JSON schema, must be declared in `customTags` in yamlls settings or LSP will flag them as "Unresolved tag"
- SchemaStore.nvim: disable built-in schema store (`schemaStore.enable = false`) and use `require("schemastore").yaml.schemas()` — auto-detects schema per filename (CF, K8s, GH Actions, etc.)
- Full YAML setup lives in `formatting.lua`: yamlls server config (SchemaStore + customTags) + conform formatter (yamlfmt)

## 🐚 Shell Script Anti-Patterns

Patterns discovered while reviewing archmaint and macfresh scripts:

- **`ls glob | wc -l` in `$()` under `set -euo pipefail`**: `ls` exits non-zero on no matches, pipefail propagates it, script aborts. Use `find` or `shopt -s nullglob` instead.
- **`brew list | wc -l` and `mas list | wc -l` under pipefail**: `brew` can exit non-zero (network, lock) and `mas` fails if not signed in — both abort mid-script. Fix: append `2>/dev/null || echo 0`.
- **`xargs cmd -- --flag`**: `--` ends option parsing so `--flag` is treated as an argument. Always put flags BEFORE `--`.
- **`grep -qi "error"` on pacman output**: `pacman -Dk` success message "No database errors have been found!" contains "errors" — always false-positive. Match more specifically.
- **`read` under `set -e`**: EOF (Ctrl+D) causes `read` to return non-zero, aborting script. Guard with `read ... || true` in interactive loops.
- **`confirm()` returning non-zero**: only safe inside an `if`-guard — calling it unconditionally aborts under `set -e`.
- **`paccache -r` without sudo**: silently fails — `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/` is root-owned. Always prefix with `sudo`.
- **`mas outdated` exits 1** when no updates exist — aborts under `set -e`. Guard with `|| true`.
- **Unquoted globs in `rm -rf`**: e.g. `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*` — quote or use find to avoid glob expansion issues.
- **`$EPOCHREALTIME` locale bug**: uses system locale decimal separator (comma on DE/EU). Normalize before arithmetic: `${EPOCHREALTIME/,/.}`.

## 📝 Scripts README Style

Confirmed across archmaint, gitstatus, pkgsync, dotfiles READMEs:

- **Title**: `# <emoji> toolname` — one emoji, lowercase tool name
- **Tagline**: single sentence immediately under title, no heading
- **`## ✨ Features`**: bullet list, each entry: `<emoji> **Bold Label** — em-dash description`
- **`## 🚀 Usage`**: bash code blocks; interactive invocation first, then flags/modes
- **`## 📋 Menu Options`**: markdown table, columns: Option | Action; options in backtick code spans
- **`## 📦 Dependencies`**: flat bullet list; note optional deps and fallbacks
- **`## 🔧 Installation`**: bash code block with `cp` + `chmod +x`; add auth/setup steps before first run
- **`## 🖥️ Requirements`**: short bullet list: OS, shell version, runtime constraints
- **Tone**: direct, present tense, active voice; concise but complete
- **All `##` headings carry an emoji**
- **READMEs live alongside the script** in each tool's subdirectory under `~/scripts/` — no separate `/docs`
- **Service/tool tables**: columns are `Service | Description | Link`; bold tool name inside Description: `**Name** — em-dash description`

## 🎵 audioshell Architecture

- Lua script injected into mpv via `--script=` to observe `media-title` / `artist` properties
- Metadata written to `/tmp/audioshell_meta_$$`, read on each event loop iteration
- Pause/resume: `SIGSTOP`/`SIGCONT` on mpv PID (no IPC, no reconnect on resume)
- Animation: `$EPOCHREALTIME` at ~3fps (bash 5+), falls back to `$SECONDS` at 1fps (bash 3.2/macOS)
- macOS compat: integer-only `read -t` on bash 3.2, detected via `$BASH_VERSION`

---

## 📋 Clipse Clipboard Manager

- **Package**: `clipse-wayland-bin` (AUR) — replaces cliphist
- **Daemon**: `clipse -listen` — self-daemonizes by spawning two `wl-paste` workers (`--type image/png` and `--type text --wl-store`); `pgrep clipse` finds nothing after launch — that's normal
- **Hyprland exec-once**: `exec-once = clipse -listen`
- **Keybinding**: `Super+V` → `kitty --class clipse -e clipse`
- **Windowrule**: float by class `clipse`, centered, currently 2400×1500
- **Config**: `~/.config/clipse/config.json` (chezmoi-tracked)
- **Image display**: `type: kitty` (crisp, requires spacebar to preview), `scaleX/scaleY` ratio 2:1 to compensate terminal cell aspect, `heightCut` trims bottom rows to avoid artifacts
- **Navigation**: `ctrl+j/k` (up/down), `ctrl+h/l` (prevPage/nextPage)
- **clipse -listen behavior**: exits immediately after spawning workers — NOT a bug; workers are the `wl-paste` processes

---

## 🖥️ Rofi Config

- **Keybinding conflicts**: Never add bare `Left`/`Right` to `kb-page-prev`/`kb-page-next` — they're already bound by rofi defaults and cause a fatal startup conflict that blocks rofi entirely. Use only `Control+h` / `Control+l` for page navigation.

## 🔌 Claude Code Plugin System

Plugin state lives in three places:
- `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` — installed plugin registry
- `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/` — downloaded plugin files
- `~/.claude/plugins/data/<plugin>-<marketplace>/` — plugin runtime data

**swift-lsp auto-resurrection**: CC re-adds `swift-lsp@claude-plugins-official` on every startup because `~/.claude.json` contains a server-fetched feature flag list that includes it. This list is Anthropic-controlled and cannot be permanently removed. **Solution**: just leave it `disabled` in `/plugin` UI — it does nothing when disabled. Don't waste time trying to purge it.

---

## 🗂️ Yazi Config

- Plugins in `~/.config/yazi/plugins/` (git repo), managed via `ya pkg` (subcommands: `add`, `install`, `upgrade`, `list`, `delete`)
- keymap.toml: use `[mgr] prepend_keymap = [...]` — mixed styles (`[[manager.prepend_keymap]]`) break bindings silently
- Shell commands use `$@` for hovered file (NOT `$1`)
- Extract: `{ on = "e", run = "shell 'ouch decompress \"$@\" --yes'", desc = "Extract archive" }`
- Compress: `{ on = "c", run = "plugin ouch", desc = "Compress file/folder" }` — ouch.yazi `entry()` prompts for name/format
- ouch.yazi: `entry()` = compress, `peek()` = archive preview — NOT an extractor
- `unrar` required for rar support
- **Active plugins**: `git`, `jump-to-char` (`f`), `mime-ext` (auto), `ouch` (`e`/`c`), `smart-enter` (`l`)
- **zoom.yazi is broken** — exits with code 127 (PATH issue in yazi sandbox), not worth debugging
- `init.lua` required for git plugin: `require("git"):setup()`
- chezmoi tracks plugins dir as a whole git repo — use `chezmoi re-add ~/.config/yazi/plugins` after any plugin changes

## 🖱️ Hyprland Cursor

- **Theme**: `Bibata-Modern-Amber` (AUR: `bibata-cursor-git`), size 32
- **Config**: `hyprland.conf` — `env = XCURSOR_THEME/SIZE` + `env = HYPRCURSOR_THEME/SIZE`
- **Apply without re-login**: `hyprctl setcursor <ThemeName> <size>`
- **GTK**: `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` — chezmoi-tracked

---

## 🛡️ Waybar VPN Widget

- Script: `~/.config/waybar/vpn.sh` — checks `tun0` interface, JSON with class `connected`/`disconnected`
- Icons: `󰌾` (nf-md-lock) = on, `󱗒` (nf-md-shield_off_outline) = off
- Tooltip shows public IP via `curl ifconfig.me`
- CSS: connected = `#A6E3A1` (green), disconnected = `#F38BA8` (red)
- Position: between `custom/battery` and `hyprland/language`
- Connect: `sudo openvpn --config ~/.config/.secrets/openvpn.ovpn --daemon`
- Disconnect: `sudo pkill openvpn`
- `.ovpn` cert paths must be absolute — relative paths fail when running from other directories

---

## 🎧 Bluetooth Audio (WH-1000XM4)

- **MAC**: `80:99:E7:2E:99:D4` — old/stale device MAC sometimes in state files: `E8:EE:CC:C5:8F:7E` (remove if found)
- **Volume control**: `~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/51-bluez-config.conf` must have `bluez5.enable-absolute-volume = true` — `false` breaks system volume slider
- **Auto-switch default sink**: WirePlumber persists default sink in `~/.local/state/wireplumber/default-nodes`; `find-selected-default-node.lua` gives saved node a +30000 priority bonus — stale MAC means headset never wins. Fix: correct the file, then `wpctl set-default <id>` to persist
- **Profile race condition** (upstream bug): log `s-device: Could not find valid non-headset profile, not switching` — fires when A2DP not yet enumerated at connect time; cosmetic once state is correct
- **After wireplumber restart**: headset may reconnect in HFP — fix with `bluetoothctl disconnect` + `bluetoothctl connect` to renegotiate A2DP

---

## 🔔 Swaync Startup Race

- `swaync.service` has `After=graphical-session.target` + `ConditionEnvironment=WAYLAND_DISPLAY` but still starts before `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is in the systemd user environment → crash-loops 4–5× at boot, misses early notifications
- **Fix**: `exec-once = systemctl --user start swaync` in `hyprland.conf` — guarantees Wayland is ready
